History
======= 

This project began life as a [Sharpen][sharpen]-based auto-port from [jsonld-java][jsonld-java].

  [sharpen]: http://community.versant.com/Projects/html/projectspaces/db4o_product_design/sharpen.html
  [jsonld-java]: https://github.com/jsonld-java/jsonld-java

It subsequently has been forked of by pietervdvn, as member of the smart mobility call for usage within the 'Itinero-Transit'-module.
It went through a major refactoring.
